Back cover blurb

JavaScript is the native language of the internet. Originally created to make web pages more dynamic, it is now used for software projects of all kinds, including scientific visualization and data services. However, most data scientists have little or no experience with it, and most introductions to it are written for people who want to build shopping carts rather than share maps of coral reefs.

This book will introduce you to JavaScript's power and ideosyncracies, and guide you through the key features of the language and its tools and libraries. The book places equal focus on client- and server-side programming, and shows readers how to create interactive web content, build and test data services, and visualize data in the browser. Topics include:

- The core features of modern JavaScript
- Creating templated web pages
- Making those pages interactive using React
- Data visualization using Vega-Lite
- Building a data service with Express
- Unit testing with Mocha
- Using Data-Forge to wrangle tabular data
